      India is emerging as a global AI hub, with heavy investments in AI education and startups. Government initiatives like the <strong>National AI Mission</strong> are paving the way for innovation in healthcare, agriculture, and logistics. 
    </p>

    <img src="images/ai-in-india.jpg" alt="AI India Initiative">

    <p>
      AI research in India is being strengthened by institutes such as IITs and IISc. Startups are building innovative solutions tailored to India's unique challenges, such as language diversity, rural connectivity, and scalable health diagnostics.

    <h3>Key Sectors Empowered by AI in India</h3>

    <button class="accordion">Healthcare</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the Indian healthcare ecosystem by providing solutions for early disease detection, medical imaging, and personalized treatment. AI-powered systems are being used to analyze complex medical data and predict patient risks, which helps in preventing critical illnesses before they escalate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Startups and institutions are leveraging AI for cancer detection, ophthalmology, and cardiology. AI algorithms trained on large datasets can scan thousands of medical images within seconds, highlighting abnormalities that may be missed by the human eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    In rural India, telemedicine platforms like <strong>eSanjeevani</strong> are powered by AI to assist with virtual consultations, helping doctors provide care remotely. AI chatbots also help patients understand symptoms and suggest possible actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, wearable devices integrated with AI are providing real-time health monitoring for chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, promoting preventive healthcare and reducing hospital visits.
  </p>
</div>


    <button class="accordion">Agriculture</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Agriculture in India is being transformed by AI technologies, especially for small and marginal farmers. AI is being used to analyze weather patterns, soil conditions, and satellite images to offer precise recommendations on what crops to plant, when to sow, and how to manage resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Startups like <strong>CropIn</strong> and <strong>NinjaCart</strong> are integrating AI for crop health monitoring and supply chain optimization. Machine learning models help detect crop diseases early using smartphone photos and alert farmers in their regional languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI also plays a crucial role in resource management. Smart irrigation systems use AI to determine how much water a crop actually needs, helping reduce water waste. Similarly, AI forecasts help farmers make informed decisions about harvesting and storing produce.
  </p>
  <p>
    These innovations are improving yields, reducing costs, and ultimately increasing the income of Indian farmers, aligning with the government's vision for "Doubling Farmers’ Income."
  </p>
</div>


    <button class="accordion">Education</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    The education landscape in India is evolving rapidly with the help of AI-powered platforms. Edtech companies are using AI to personalize the learning experience for each student by tracking their progress and adapting lessons based on their strengths and weaknesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Platforms such as <strong>BYJU’S</strong>, <strong>Vedantu</strong>, and <strong>Embibe</strong> use AI to provide interactive learning modules, live quizzes, and personalized feedback. This helps keep students engaged and enables them to learn at their own pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, AI tools like natural language processing and speech recognition are making education more accessible by translating study materials into regional languages. This is a big boost for students in rural and non-English-speaking areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teachers are also benefiting from AI. Automated grading and plagiarism detection tools save time, allowing educators to focus more on teaching than administrative work. AI can even identify learning gaps in a classroom and suggest interventions for teachers.
  </p>
</div>


   <button class="accordion">Smart Governance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    AI is enabling a shift towards proactive and predictive governance in India. By analyzing data from various government services, AI helps authorities identify patterns, predict bottlenecks, and optimize service delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
    In cities, AI is being used to manage traffic flow through intelligent signal systems and CCTV surveillance, which reduces congestion and enhances safety. For example, cities like Hyderabad and Mumbai are adopting smart traffic management using AI analytics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Law enforcement agencies are deploying facial recognition software and crime mapping tools to improve surveillance and ensure better response to criminal activity. AI is also being used to detect fraudulent activities in welfare schemes and direct subsidies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through digital platforms, AI chatbots assist citizens in accessing government schemes, filing complaints, and getting status updates. This increases transparency and reduces delays, bringing public services closer to the people.
